R: Beyond Basics
Instructor: Duncan Temple Lang

This is a series of 3 workshops 12.30pm - 3.30pm September 10, 12, 14 - Monday, Wednesday and Friday. 

We will go beyond "getting started in R", but the material will be accessible to be people who are
just at that stage and beyond.

The intent is to make people proficient and confident in using "best practices" for
leveraging R and writing good code. This is about why we do things, rather than learning function names.

Topics covered will include
+ How to reason about R code and R's computational model.
+ Writing R functions for flexibility and reusability.
+ Debugging.
+ Making code efficient, and different approaches to problems.
+ Creating R packages.
+ Object oriented programming basics.
And we'll answer any R-related questions.

The format will be a mix of presentation and hands on problem solving/working on code.
You'll actually code better.


If you have code you want to make more efficient/simpler/better, please contact me ASAP and we can consider
using that as a case study.

Prerequisites:  Everyone is expected to have basic familiarity with R and be able to write a simple function.
