We came across an interesting problem a few weeks ago

The main code calls

    plot(unjacked, type = "l", lwd = 2, col = "blue", main = "ROC Curve for Unjackknifed Positive and Negative Sites")

The error message is 
```
  formal argument "type" matched by multiple actual arguments
```

What is going on here?

How do you go about finding the problem?
